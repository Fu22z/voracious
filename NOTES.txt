Next steps:
- Reconsider how we store media/subs; rather than by language, might want just uids. Could mark whichever media/textChunks as 'native' vs. 'translation'
- Check style guide on curlies spacing, etc.
- Get eslint going?
- Display the computed current subs somewhere
- Jump-back button and kbd shortcut
- Un-halfwidth subs on import
- Display more summary info (sub tracks, media presence)
- Integrate JS-mecab
- Try JS-mecab on simple OCR output?
- Consume OCR result
  - 0028.jpg is good, has errors/confusion
  - Do we need to ignore summary result and go off pieces alone? Is summary result always the concat of pieces? Seems like we want to go through and make spans with uids, and make corresponding divs over image.

Keyboard shortcuts:
- general idea is to keep one hand in position on keyboard. let's say left hand, since most people mouse with right. and let's say home row, so asdf+space
- controls:
  - SPACE: toggle play/pause for video, go to to next page for comic
  - A: jump-back N seconds for video, go to previous page for comic
  - S: ?
  - D: toggle transcription
  - F: toggle translation

What are controls?
- new document (of given type, language)
- import media
- import subs
- re-analyze current section?
- media nav (depends on document type, has keyboard shortcuts)
  - comics
    - forward/back pages
  - video/audio
    - pause/resume
    - rewind, replay last section
    - auto-pause checkbox

What contraints should hold for text?
- For a video, it seems that all text should be inside a timed chunk? And the times should be sequential (in start times at least, overlaps could be allowed). Times could also be nested perhaps(?), but then they should still be in order.
- For a comic, it seems that similarly all text should be inside a "page" chunk, and pages must be sequential. Pages could be skipped of course. Pages shouldn't nest.
- For just-text (novel, article), it doesn't seem like we have any basic structural constraints.
- For videos and comics and such, should match the media.

Could we allow videos and comics to have text outisde chunks/pages, but just emit warnings?

Should we wrap videos and comics and such in different top-level custom elements? Maybe just a data attribute or something to indicate which 'type' it is? Or do we just infer that by the top-level setting for the whole 'document'.
