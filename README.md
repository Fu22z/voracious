# Voracious

Voracious is a power tool for foreign language learners to get the most out of watching videos, readings comics, etc. It lets you easily:
- toggle the display of transcriptions/translations
- look up definitions of unknown words
- save excerpts for later SRS study
- (for video) quickly rewind to hear tricky speech again
- (for comics) extract text from images with OCR
