# Voracious

Voracious is a power tool for foreign language learners to get the most out of watching videos, readings comics, etc. It lets you easily:
- toggle the display of transcriptions/translations
- rewind video to re-listen to tricky speech
- automatically generate furigana for Japanese text
- _(coming soon)_ look up definitions of unknown words
- _(coming soon)_ clip excerpts for later SRS study
- _(coming soon)_ extract text from comics/images with OCR

## Running in development mode

```
npm install
npm run build
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Browse to http://localhost:8000/

## Getting Started

Voracious is just a rough prototype, but to try it out:
- Click `Create New Document`
- By `Import Video` choose a video file to load
- By `Import Subs` choose one or more subtitle files to load (selecting the language for each one)
- Use the video controls and buttons/key-shorcuts to play video, hide/reveal subtitles, etc.
